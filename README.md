- 👋 Hi, I’m @VikkiWalls
- 👀 I’m interested in data science for social good, and am particularly interested in in health, energy and environments, space, and arts (gaming, animation)
- 🌱 I’m about to graduate from my Masters in Data Science
    * I recently got to to defend my Masters thesis
        * The project is based on investigating the metabolomics of Alzheimer's Disease (I hope to share it here once it's been marked)🤞
- 🗣️ Coding in Python and Wolfram Mathematica
    * I also have a small amount of experience in R
- 💼 I'm currently lookng for Data Scientist roles - particularly in domains where I feel I can contribute towards the data science for social good movement
