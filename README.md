- 👋 Hi, I’m @VikkiWalls
- 👀 I’m interested in doing projects that matter! I love big ideas and the concept of using data science for social good. 
  - Some specific domains that interest me are:
      - ⚗️ Health Research
      - ⚡ Energy and Renewables
      - 🌍 The Environment
      - 🪐 Space
      - 🎮 The Arts
- 🌱 I’m about to graduate from my Masters in Data Science
    * I recently got to to defend my [Masters thesis](https://github.com/VikkiWalls/Metabolomics-in-Alzheimer-s-Disease---An-Investigation-into-Conflicting-Methodologies-and-Results)
        * The project is based on investigating the metabolomics of Alzheimer's Disease
- 👩‍💻 Coding in Python and Wolfram Mathematica
    * I also have a small amount of experience in R
- 💼 I'm currently lookng for Data Scientist roles - particularly in domains where I feel I can contribute towards the data science for social good movement
- ❤️‍🩹 I recently signed up to be a Volunteer Data Scientist at the [Data Science for Social Good Foundataion](http://www.datascienceforsocialgood.org/) Solve Programme (DSSGS)
